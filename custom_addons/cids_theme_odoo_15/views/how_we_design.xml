                        and the broader design goals in detail, our team sets the tone, look, and feel of each and every
                        space with utmost perfection. To define the overall aesthetics of the interiors, we create
                        ideas, form inspirational mood boards, and give creative design directions. At CIDS.DESIGN, we
                        also closely look at the flow and functionality of spaces within the experimental parameters of
                        the built environment.</p>

                        individual elements can be used. A series of concept boards are built, forming the basis for
                        materials and furniture specifications needed for the interior finishings. At CIDS.DESIGN, we
                        extensively consider the interior detailing required for flooring, walls, and structures by
                        taking into account the key focal points such as accent decor, fireplaces, artefacts, and more.
                        We also pay great attention to how the interiors relate to the outdoor surrounding areas like
                        gardens and landscapes.</p>
